3) Description of the input data:

- Individual Labels: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity (9 subjects for test, 21 for train)
file: subject_train.txt (7352 rows) / subject_test.txt (2947 rows)

- Activities Description: each record identifies a code and the corresponding activity (like walking, sitting, etc.) performed by a subject during the study
file: activity_labels.txt (6 records)

- Activity labels: Each row identifies the activity code related to that set of data
file: y_train.txt (7352 records) / y_test.txt (2947 records)

- Feature vector: 2 files contain the Information about the variables/features collected during the study
file:features_info.txt : explanation of the meaning of each variable/feature
file: features.txt (561 records) : list of all features

- Datasets: 2 files contain the datasets for training and testing data
file: X_train.txt (7352 rows, 561 columns) / X_test.txt (2947 rows, 561 columns)

- Acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer on each axis X, Y, Z (standard gravity units 'g')
file: total_acc_x_train.txt / total_acc_y_train.txt/ total_acc_z_train.txt (7352 rows, 128 columns)
file: total_acc_x_test.txt / total_acc_y_test.txt / total_acc_z_test.txt (2947 rows, 128 columns)

file: body_acc_x_train.txt / body_acc_y_train.txt / body_acc_z_train.txt (7352 rows, 128 columns)
file: body_acc_x_test.txt /  body_acc_y_test.txt /  body_acc_z_test.txt (2947 rows, 128 columns)

file: body_gyro_x_test.txt / body_gyro_y_test.txt / body_gyro_z_test.txt (2947 rows, 128 columns)

4) Load the files into R in the following dataframes:
- activlabels: activity labels definition
- features: list of all features
- testsubj: subjects for test dataset
- testdata: test dataset
- testactiv: activities for test dataset
- trainsubj: subjects for train dataset
- traindata: train dataset
- trainactiv: activities for train dataset

5) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
- merge individual labels, activity labels (from y_train.txt) and dataset for train set with cbind
- merge individual labels, activity labels (from y_test.txt) and dataset for test set with cbind
- merge the train and test set into a new data set that has individual and activity label for each record (use rbind)
- name 1st column = "individual", 2nd = "activityno", and every other column using the features.txt file

6) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- use grep to select all the columns whose name contain "mean", "Mean" or "std"
- add the first 2 columns "individual" and "activityno" and save a new dataframe meanstddata with all the selected columns

7) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- based on the values in the activity label column, add for each record the corresponding description based on activity_labels.txt
- use inner_join function from dplyr package to link the column with activity codes and the column with activity descriptions
- rearrange column orders so that the 3rd column of the dataset will have "walking", "sitting", etc.

8) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
- change variable names with a series of commands in order to make the names easier to understand

9) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
- group data by activity and subject and calculate the mean for each variable using the aggregate function
- rename the first 2 column as "individual" and "activity" since aggregate created them with default values "V1", "V2"

10) Save data in output file
Save final tidy dataframe in file FinalData.txt which can be read back in R with:
read.table("FinalData.txt", header = TRUE)
